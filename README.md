  <p>“The reality of the symbol is entirely determined by your communication.<br> Because the symbol existence is nothing more than the materialization of this communication.”</p>
<p>(VÓLOCHINOV, 1895)</p>

<p>The philosophy of language highlights the symbolic communication into the interrelation between the language and the thoughts.<br>
Symbolic communication can be a symbol with socially accepted meaning, used in flags, signboards, and so on.<br>
Symbolic communication also is a tool for visual artists. The humans thoughts are through images and the symbols socially associated. When we think about feeling, for example, love, angry, fear, compassion, we remembered scenes, colors, sounds, that reminds us the sensations. The visual artists are brilliant in capture the scene and the symbols that most combine and pass it through the paintings. </p>
  <p><br>Social history are registered in painting and also the humans feelings. One of the reason that makes visual artists good communicators and an effective way of storytelling, we recognize the feelings represented and its make the audience understand the sensation of the moment and be inside the scene.</p>

<p>“Most experiences are unsayable, they happen in a space that no word has ever entered,<br> and more unsayable than all other things are works of art, those mysterious existences, <br>whose life endures besides our own small, transitory life.”</p>
  <p>(RILKE, 1934)</p>
